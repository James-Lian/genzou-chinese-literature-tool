# Genzou: A React-Native Expo application for the convenient learning of Chinese
This is a mobile app currently being developed in React Native and Expo, inspired by a similar [Python tool](https://github.com/James-Lian/python-chinese-literature-assistant).  
If you wanted a faster way to learn from Chinese textbooks, look no further than Genzou (è·Ÿèµ°)!  
This app is filled with features like Pinyin conversion, translation, and a dictionary.  
Scan your textbooks and novels with your phone camera to upload the text to the editor, where you can add Pinyin pronunciation to complex Chinese characters, convert your Chinese to English, have your phone read the text aloud to you, and highlight specific words and phrases to look them up in a dictionary.

### Known Errors
After translating maybe only a couple of sentences, you might receive a TooManyRequests Error. This has to do with the translator API (which isn't exactly free ðŸ˜…). There might come a day where I'll fix it, but for now use a better full-sentence translation app, like Google Translate.
